<p>  The blue whale is the largest animal on the planet, weighing as much as 200 tons(approximately 33 elephants).
    <br> The blue whale has a heart the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. Its stomach can hold one ton of krill and it needs to eat about four tons of krill each day.
    <br> They are the loudest animals on Earth and are even louder than a jet engine. Their calls reach 188 decibels, while a jet reaches 140 decibels.
    <br> Their low frequency whistle can be heard for hundreds of miles and is probably used to attract other blue whales.
    <br> Blue whales are found in all oceans except the Arctic. They generally migrate seasonally between summer feeding grounds and winter breeding grounds, but some evidence suggests that individuals in certain areas might not migrate at all.
    <br> Information about distribution and movement varies with location, and migratory routes are not well known. In general, distribution is driven largely by food availabilityâ€”they occur in waters where krill are concentrated.
